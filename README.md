A minimalistic to-do list based on [Ugmonk's Analog](https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog).
This repo contains the file for this simple but effective analog to-do list.

## Models

There are two main models of the card holder:
- ***Original***

- ***2-Layers:***
![2-Layers model](analog-todo-cad\Renders\2-Layers?raw=true)
The 2-Layers model has, as it says, two layers, so you can save your already completed to-do lists.

Both versions come with and without the logo. You can also edit the files to add your own logo.

## Dimensions

The main dimensions are the following: 130 mm deep, 83 mm wide and 30 mm high, which works great with A7 sheets (74 mm x 105 mm). It is suggested to use thick paper so tha it can hold itself.
You can see a ISO A4 Drawing of both models:

Both drawings are available as PDFs inside the `Drawings` folder.

## Files
All the files to 3D print or CNC are located inside the `Files` folder and are separated between the two models.

## Tech
