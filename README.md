A minimalistic to-do list based on [Ugmonk's Analog](https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog).
This repo contains the file for this simple but effective analogue to-do list.

## Models

There are two main models of the cardholder:
***Original:***

***2-Layers:***

The 2-Layers model has, as it says, two layers so that you can save your already completed to-do lists.

Both versions come with and without the logo. You can also edit the files to add your logo.

## Dimensions

The main dimensions are 130 mm deep, 83 mm wide, and 30 mm high.
You can see an ISO A4 Drawing of both models:

Both drawings are available as PDFs inside the `Drawings` folder.

## Files
All the files to 3D print or CNC are located inside the `Files` folder and are separated between the two models.
The files are STL, STEP and 3DM (Rhino). If you need another type of file, you can export it from Onshape.

## Tech

The models were made using [Onshape](cad.onshape.com).
You can see, export and copy them from [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ebf0b4a6337dbe4dbe8edf49/w/e62f7297846c94e0e0251c75/e/5c45ceb4d58021267a99867e?renderMode=0&uiState=6319f7bd873c8a0c2c6e0c22).

The renders were done using [KeyShot 11](https://www.keyshot.com/keyshot-11/).
